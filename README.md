# Paueddium

Paueddium is an open-source 1.20.1 client performance mod for Minecraft which forks from Embeddium 0.3.32, which is based on Sodium


## About

Paueddium stands for:<br> 
"𝑷𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝑨𝘯𝘥 𝑼𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘴 on Emb𝒆𝒅𝒅𝒊𝒖𝒎⚡⚡⚡"

As we prioritize bleeding edge performance and updates for Embeddium from the latest sodium builds *Mod compatability is NOT the main priority*

Paueddium is **not supported by Embbeddedt, nor by CaffeineMC** if you encounter any issues report them here and not their bug trackers

## Highlights

* As much performance improvements from the latest sodium build (**currently Sodium 0.6**), i.e. a rewritten terrain renderer, various optimizations to the immediate-mode rendering pipeline (used by entities, GUIs, block entities, etc.), and other miscellaneous improvements
* Available for Minecraft Forge on 1.20.1 and older, and Fabric/NeoForge on 1.20.1 and newer
* Integrated Fabric Rendering API support (Indium is no longer required, and will not work with Embeddium)
* Frequent patch updates to fix mod compatibility issues soon after being reported & reproduced
* Additional APIs for mod integration
* Optional support for translucency sorting (can be enabled in Video Settings)

## Credits

* Embeddedt for creating & maintaining upstream
* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible
* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge
* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds
* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5
